<div class="uberschrift">Video Editing</div>

On this page, I would like to show, how I edit my videos and what apps I use. I also explain, how I make my audio visualizer as well.

<div class="uberschrift-3">Basic video editing - Hitfilm Express</div>
<p>At the moment, I am using Hitfilm Express since 2020. Hitfilm Express is the free version of Hitfilm itself and the cool thing about it, that it lets you 
decide to pick, whatever plugins, effects etc. you need for your editing. Since I am doing music videos, I bought the Audio FX Expansion, which is the 
visualizer you see in most of my recent videos. </p>

<p>In Hitfilm you can create a visualizer by dragging any audio file into the project media folder. Then you need to create a composite shot, which is basically a group
of layers. Here you can drag the audio, the audio FX and make some texts here too. Drag the audio first, then the audio plugin so you can find it under
Effects > Audio Input > choose Song. Once you have done that, it automatically creates the visualizer for you and now you can start tweaking.</p>

<p><div class="uberschrift-3">Effects</div> Besides the audio plugin, my common effects are Contrast, Vignette, sometimes Blur and Shake. The shake effect makes the a bit less static 
when the beats are dropping. The blur effect sometimes can look pretty modern too. Contrast is my usual effect since many years. I have a dark room with 
bad natural light so contrast can hide these spots better. Vignette gives a nice touch alongside the contrast.</p>

<div class="uberschrift-2">Free alternatives</div>
<p><b><u>Avee Player</u></b>
 is a great Windows UWP app, that also runs on the phone. It lets you create a visualizer with many different options, which makes it a bit complicated at first.
There are some presets you can use for basic effects though. You only need to change the song and add some text or background. I would have used it all the time, as the presets
lets you create a visualizer quickly but for whatever reason, the sound of the rendered videos have crackling noises. It also lets you just render the videos in 30 FPS 
in the current version. Due to that reason, I stopped using it for now

</p>

<p><b><u>Astrofox</u></b>
is a free and open source alternative to Avee Player. It is still in development and has way less features for now. You can only choose from a handful effects and
visualizers and there are less ways for customizing them. The interface also is not very intuitive yet. However, if simple visualizers are enough, Astrofox 
is a great choice. Hopefully, we can see new improving updates soon.

</p>

<p><b><u>Shotcut</u></b>
is another free and open source alternative for video editing software. In my opinion, Shotcut is one of the best alternatives out there, 
which is being developed by a community. The good thing beside being free is the amount of effects and options. The first thing
that you probably encounter is performance - no matter how fast your computer is. That's something, you need to get used to over time.
That does not mean, that if you edit 4k files, you end up in the hell of lag: you can improve that by using the proxy function, making basically smaller files of the original 
for a smoother edit. I also recommend shotcut if you quickly want to trim or render something. It's perfect for that. I already used it 
as a lazy replacement for Hitfilm, when my video was only about edits. For audio visualizers, you have one effect here, but it clearly doesn't look
that good as it does in Hitfilm in my opinion.

<p><b><u>Deprecated video editing tools:</u></b>
<p>
    The first video editing tool I used was <u>Sony Vegas Movie Studio 9</u>, later <u>version 11</u>. It was my main editing tool and it worked quite well. I would 
    still recommend it because it is easy to use and beginner friendly. The amount of effects were enough to make a good video edit - if 
    you however focus on making multiple scenes of yourself playing, then it is enough anyway. What bugged me after a while were the small hiccups it had. It 
    was sadly also one of more unstable apps I used. Always hit CTRL+S! For a while, I was also using <u>Sony Vegas Pro Edit 14</u>. 
    It was in a humble bunlde for cheap but the edit version was not even better than the movie studio version.</p>
