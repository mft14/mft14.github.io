  <p>Did you know, last year, August 2023, I made a last minute wedding present for my best friend with their house cat named Coco?</p>
    <p>I used <a href="https://microstudio.dev"/>Microstudio</a> and took the pre-existing cat game, modified the levels, added custom graphics and wrote a small OST for the game.</p>
    <p>The worst part was that the server crashed and I lost all my progress. I had to start over from scratch and I had only 2 days left to finish it.</p>
    <p>It was a lot of fun and I am very happy with the result. I hope you enjoy it too!</p>
