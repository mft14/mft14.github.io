Seems so. \n\nI can not believe, that I started as 15 years old dude, just coming from an apprentice ship, trying to buy all these audio equipments to make my first covers. Man was I psyched, when I got everything together. As some of you know, I started already in December 2011 but with bad equipment and cracked Mixcraft haha.  I said, I want to make it legally so I tried to work and get all these things together. Then the first cover appeared and the feeling was so good, making a new fresh start. I already knew in a few days, I would cover my first TF2 song - the main theme. and out of surprise, Valve dropped their Mann Vs. Machine video with the awesome The Calm soundtrack. I think it was just two days after the trailer and I made that cover, because it was too hype.\n\nGlad so many people stumbled across over The Calm video back then and found my channel. If they left or not - thanks for being a part of here!  It is amazing to see back to those 10 years. Many things improved, like sound, video quality or my English in general - but I think, that I did not become much better than before playing guitar.  I am just a bit more confident and got condition. \n\nThat is all. My same motto from 2012 still exists: Make the music as loud as possible: I don not want to write many more things. \n\nThanks for everyone joining by, gave funny comments, liked, whatever. When there is something I tried to achieve was not being annoying by advertising my channel. I am also sorry for everybody, who suggested covers in the comments over the years but never got (even though I sometimes even promised :[ ). I hope, someone else did it better ! I have no idea how to continue with this channel but I don not think, I will stop it. For now, I will focus on new things and I can not wait to bind this channel into it somehow :] For next weeks and months, you will see me more on Spotify trying to upload new stuff there!\n\nDankesch√∂n, everyone!", },

The album should be ready in one month, maybe earlier. I still need to draw some cool album art and then licensing. Thanks to the amazing guys at Soundrop, this shouldn't be no problem and be safe for the end of the world. Yes, without a license, it could be that songs might be taken down. But not with Soundrop! If you are musician and want to bring out your music: Do it there. Otherwise, to the whole album, I can say, I am sorry  that the end took a bit longer than expected. I mean with the speed of before, I could have finished this easily in January this year but I suddenly had, again, mixing problems and it also was private life and new school/work I had. But this is the last song and I am glad, not I am only the one that loves this OST so much but many of you too appreciate this fun little game. If you never played it, it's one of the best Tower Defense game I know, packed with the amazing soundtrack, cute plants, weirdo zombies and cool humour!", },

Graze the roof is one of the best songs in the whole game. For a good reason! I thought I would give this song another remix and focus more its groovy parts! Btw the 'slowdown' later on is one cool feature from Renoise: While traditionally, you would drop the tempo, I dropped the lines per beat, meaning I just reduced to a 3/4 but still playing it as a 4/4 beat. You don not know what I am talking about? That is fine, enjoy the song now :D", },

Is there still any TF2 server left hosting this? My old favourite server all got shut down sadly. What a not nicely christmas morning day for all fallen servers. And check out the official music video from the background theme if you haven't.

Chapter 2 already has been out and I cover this old one. But hey, good songs never get old :)\n\n However, Jevil Theme is something that is laying around for ages and wow, after 3 years, I manage it. It never should have been a standard metal cover for me, as other do it better. For me, this theme is such an earworm and its tempo makes me wanna go crazy so I thought there MUST be something metal and hardstyle frenchcore similar genre mixed together. It is VERY unsual for me to go this fast with the drums, as you might notice in other covers, I love dubstep and prefer half time on the drums (Well I couldnt stay without so the accordion part has it :) ) but here, it needs to go boom boom 4 times a beat.

I was just immigrating all my music production to Linux (this is way harder than it sounds), collecting new sound and samples, preparing some new visualizers + video editing and was grinding the new (buggy) Forza 5 and Minecraft :D\n\n RequestFest will be continued in 2022.

The leads are typcially super fast paced, perfect for rhythm games like these. I can already see my legs twisting while trying to dance like this on a dancing pad. However, was a lot of fun making this but also a lot of frustration at first. I didnt just find a perfect imitation of these vocals first. The voice of the guns man (i have no idea how they are both called so I call the left dude guns man, the right boy looks swag) originally had an 8bit that went through a vowel filter but somehow this didnt cut through the mix well.\n\n For swag boy I had trumpet first but this was way to fast, it sounded unreal. After a lots of tries with saw waves and deunted saw chords, I found that vocal sample and it was clear enough to cut through well. Then it was just a matter of fun to make this remix. Hope you enjoy!\n\n Next request: No idea what hint I can give so: It's from Monster Hunter Tri and has to do with Lagiacrus (I wonder if that game was originally for the Wii, if yes, I was there when the server were shut down, it was a sad day for me and a friend @Clamon)", },

Ok, almost maybe. Making music with trackers. Meaning there is no visual style of the notes. Just notes as written code basically! I know this software for a while but I was like this is too complicated for me. But Monti64, a friend of mine, worked recently with Hyrule Magic. An editor for changing the music notes and instruments for the game Zelda A Link To The Past. After seeing what he crafted there in changing instruments, this inspired me to get back to Renoise (the software you see). I learned for a little and after getting in the flow, this software makes ultra fun!

The riff basically has several sections and work together well. Couldn't stop myself to repeat the best ones and create excitement as usual. I was kind of worries that this might be too guitar based but at the end, I think, I found a good middle way of heavy parts and softer parts.\n\n All in all, great and catchy song, made for metal and had a lot of fun with.

It still took me a week to arrange because I just stucked with the ideas again and making the trumpets fitting the speed took a while.

Even thought I let it pass for this week but I release it like this and I hope that the requester like it! Not the usual length for my cover but yeah, as I said, how to arrange a song like this, where the melody basically tells a story with a unique melody. Took my best to make it shining on the guitar so I hope it is okay. I am glad I finished it though, now it sounds not too bad and it definitely is a beautiful song. Sadly I never played the Black Ops series, it seems I missed a lot of good COD content right there but back when MW3 was released, I played TF2 to death :D\n\n Next request: Time to get back to some brawling action with meta revenges?

I had SO much fun covering this. While working on it, I blasted my speaker with Lost Lands 2021 Vampa set that actually gave me a bit of riddim influences, so I decided to go super heavy riddim in the second part of this song. All in all, the song was (finally) not too hard to make and I thought, that main riff is what I can extend to death. Luckily it wa sin Eb so it can be made really heavy on guitar!\n\nThis leaves me a lot of freedom! While letting the guitar blast this riff, I often try to find other sounds that work pretty well. I decided to find a distorted cyberpunk synth, that just goes brrwww and the layer with guitar is pretty cool I think. Otherwise, pretty straight forward arrangement I think. The Damage drum library again fits super well for making these war drums grooves and this part is what I enjoyed the most. The original songs seems to be very short so I extended it a bit with the arrangement. Sadly I did not find any TORNADO man shouting sample, due to the comments under the original song, I think, this would have fit pretty well haha\n\nThanks for any requests so far, I am having a great time discovering new music, that I wouldnt have touched probably!

Bowser's Castle but faster and crazier ? With DJ scratches and random samples? Also Bowser, I didn't know you have some serious Dance skills? Request accepted! Dethraxx also known as the GOAT of VGM Covers surely had to request me some of the good old Dolphin stuff and this one is no exception. It's a remix yes but a remix of a remix? 5head POG! The tempo makes this song completely different compared to the original and its structure and arrangement fits wonderful to this dance. I still give them 8 of 10 points in the production difficulty because the new arrangement, lots of arps and these voice ad libs samples were hard to figure out at first. Step by step, I made it then. Since it is a techno like song, I decided to go fully synthy with this, I originally had my trumpets included but it did not fit so this one should work out better.\n\nAs often, I remix the songs how they are originally arranged, then I take the coolest parts or riffs and make a riser out of them. The beginning riff really invited me for doing that so I took that and also layered some heavy beefy 8bit bass on it which makes my guitar shining completely different now. It made it also a lot more heavier, also by using a trance plucky bass. In the second half, I went fully metal with a riddim structure, based on riddim dubstep music. At the end, I decided to go fully hardstyle kinda like, this is usually not my first choice in EDM but I think, it fits here pretty well.

It's been a while playing some Binding of Isaac but oh yeah, I remember this soundtrack too good. It is one of these heavy doomish tracks that have a guitar in the background but it still fits very good to the atmosphere of the whole song. The song itself was a bit hard to figure out. The guitar is, as just said, the main focus here but on the other hand, very hard to figure out. With the tricks of nowadays software, I was able to recreate the whole guitar riff was best as possible.\n\n Arrangement-wise, I did Nothing this time. Very uncommon for me but this song does not need it. The whole song ends after 2 minutes of action so I thought it would be cool to play this song in a typical metal style (the first part until 2 minutes), then the doomish part. What sounds better? Very hard to say. For people who are not playing guitar, a quick explination: Doomish guitar is played very low but there is a limit on how you can go and how it sounds. The lower, the less details, that's why DOOM has a lot of tracks with playing not too complex structure. Here I had the same struggle but I just went full doom mode and you basically can now decide, what sounds better for you! Anyway thanks for this suggestion, without I would have never touched it probably!\n\nNext request: Bowser's Castle but remixing a remix", },

The arrangement structure is very interesting, a bit chopped I'd say but still with a good transition.\n\nThat riff was also my favourite parts, which why it got extended loop by myself! The fast solo took a while to figure out but it was in a decent length, so I didnt get bored quickly! (fast solos needs to be slowed down to like 0,5x speed, so putting all these notes step by step takes a while) Sadly I don't have such a great shouting choir available so I replaced it with other instruments.

Thanks randomizer! :D I only know the soviet march song from this game so when reading this title made me thinking of another good song and yeah hell was I not wrong. This song and probably the whole OST gives the feeling of a war game, influenced from our real history. The guitar riffs from the original were quite heavy so I tried to capture that with my kind of metal sound, which was (for me) the harder part remixing the song.\n\nAlso the non metal parts at the beginning for example are always tricky to do. I mean, I describe myself as a decent intermediate sound designer now but making a good sound design QUICK for a remix is not an easy task. My secret here is using pieces of the real song and stretch them out with a plugin called HalfTime ; then I generate excitement with NI libraries called Evolve, put some dubstep riser samples on it and Let's goo!\n\nAt some parts, the guitar was kinda tricky to figure out so I am sorry for some small mistakes here!

Imagine playing MP1 with ammo) Can say, that it's definitely not a problem in the game and you can fill it up very easy so it's not big of a deal.

Misfortune Teller is btw a song I tried to cover 2 times before but 2 times scrapped. The first version was in the same year of release, the 2nd try must have been around 2017.

The major/minor switch in the middle makes this song very special for some reason. Musically theoretically-wise (yes, I have learned that back in college), I would assume that the major part is the friendly vibe sitting on a campfire, drinking beer while the minor part shows the real madness of Engineer, so he invented the sentries to kill everybody, who wants to disturb his chilling vibes. :D  What I can say is: This was definitely NOT the last \"\"More Gun\"\" cover , I did.

Why did this one take so long? Various reasons: The strongest one goes back to 2013 where I covered this song the first time. I was in a rush, even forgot to wear my CAP in the video and at the end, I was never really content of how that cover turned out. Sound wise, I tried to make that heavy telecaster tone by duplicating the guitar clip and dropped it one octave down. I used that technoque often but in that particular cover of Demoman's theme, it just didn't sound good. The second approach, which is on the Medal Fortress album, was better. I enjoyed the arrangement of the first theme but in the end, I didn't really record this well if you ask me. So if you still want to take a look on the old video, you can find it on the top right corner but I warned you!    So here is it: The ultimate whistling theme from the original - put in an arrangement of Bagpipes like a real scottish bloke! Hell yes!  There is also another thing, that bugs me a lot. I was planning to put this album on Spotify and co. but for some reasons, me and my distributor couldn't figure out the license rights there, because I was planning to upload the first 8 new TF2 songs on Spotify as single yet. That's really sad and that pulled out the motivation energy a bit of continuing... But once I had the idea of the great Badpipe arrangement, I just had to do this one. Enjoy the scottish mighty power of .. √§hm, √úber Badpipes played √ºber bad because √∂hm.. Drunk?  Oh, it also has been ages doing new Posters in SFM again. The last one were made in 2012, where I basically started making my first TF2 covers. As an easteregg, they used to be on my computer screen, which you are able to see in the videos. CPU was crap back then, I guess.   If you are curious of how I made the bagpipe so wide: I used Celtic Pipes (Kontakt library) + a synthetic bagpipe I made myself in Serum (tutorial of that someday) and my own bagpipe from Amazon - all layered. That made the wide effect!  Edit 10 January 2021: I finally made that tutorial but back then, that was only paid software. Now there is a complete free way of making virtual bagpipes if you ever need some badpipy tones for your music production.

I rarely try this out in videos especially for Youtube but I think, this experimental sound worked out fine! I tried lots of percussion combined with lighter drums. In the beginning, I wanted to introduce the song kind of future bassy because of the environment of the bowser road. At the end I tried to blast the main theme with some horns and choirs. I hope you like this experimental remix again, it's been a long time since another experimental remix. I think, the last one was Cynthias Theme.  Enjoy!\"" },

Most games I know are riddle games which are perfect for smartphones but there are also triple A kind games that would need a lot of time investments. Last mentioned is nothing for me so I mostly prefer the riddle games. And this one has the cutest OST I've ever heard so I had to cover it as the first mobile game cover :D\"" },

YT was full of glitch videos and how to access areas you normally would not go to in your casual run. So did I find ways to access Arceus and all the other legendaries. Yet I have to say though that I indeed reached the black mystery zone but I never got to the legendaries since it is some complex way of doing it.

I am super glad to see that people still requested it in this year. Even the composer, Scott mighty Lloyd Shelly saw my stuff which I am super happy about the positive feedback. This is, how I imagine world life.  Why did I need so long for this medley? I can tell you. First of all, the 1.2 Update was end of 2013. When I remember it correctly, the 1.3 Update came out in summer of 2014. Facts about that are, that I always wanted to cover some of these songs alone, e. g. Martian Madness or Mushroom. But you don't know, how much I canceled these attempts. They just did not sound right to me. I am super glad, that I waited with those decision because I always have been like: In the future, you will be worth to cover it massively better than now. I have to say: Yes!  So I am super content of the Medley. I know I know; there are two 1.2 Update songs I included at the beginning and end but the Frost Moon just shouted to be the opening song, since it , at least for me, gave me such a huge Christmas vibe. Originally, the Mushroom theme was not included since yesterday, where I said; let's make it and make it super dizzy. And purple. Yum, the Mushroom guy in the game was my favorite dude in the game :D I love Mushrooms, they count to my staple food.  What's left to say? Terraria songs always were super special for me. The game itself was the second game in my Steam library back in 2011 after TF2 but basically the first game I have bought on Steam. Fun times playing around in the worlds with friends - at that time even with Microsoft Skype. The updates were so cool and brought lots of new ideas, which often made me and my friends playing it again. And that very addicting - excessive addicting like Stardew Valley. But the soundtracks, which I said, are super interesting and different but fitting extremly well and create such an interesting vibe." },

Route 205 is a duty for me to cover. I am rewatching the DPPT anime atm where I started off in June and it is been a great time since I actually stopped watching the 12 season. But wow, this Route theme often comes at the end of an episode and it still gives me goosebumps. It reminds me of the great old time in Summer 2008, where I spent the days outside with friends in my home village, eating sweets from Bartsch under the stairs and enjoying the time.  This song always hits me as well as Route 209. What a great tune as well I have to say. All in all, those songs in this generation are really different but in a good way. I really wonder, if there will be a remake of those games. The last song is one of the grooviest and happiest songs I have ever heard. I just had to cover it and I hope you enjoy this little playthrough !  To be honest, when I started with Youtube, I actually never wanted to make those music videos styles, I always wanted to make the songs like this one: Make it possible to play it on your own without changing the instruments. I still want to upload regularly but the more scenes you record, the longer the whole video makes. Since with school and work, I try to still have quality audio but making the stuff simple as possible. My lifestyle totally changed since I am seeing the consumption very negative for myself. Music videos with lots of scenes are still more fun to watch but for the moment, I hope you can enjoy those playthroughs and it might be also easier for tabs I could do in the future, if songs are tab-suggested.

Older days, you discovered more and more, that made those games super fun to see and the fun never ended. Unfortunately, I never had the fun to collect everything, which is different today.

If you wonder why my comeback is that late this year: As you might have seen, I made my album completed, which was a lot of work too. But the main reason was probably the own synthesizer I made with Reaper's built-in scripting language called JesuSonic (JS). Wow. It gave me a totally different view of how complicated audio effects really are. Please do me a favor and, when it is not overpriced, give audio plugin guys the money. They really deserve it. I can approve that. I am really content of how the 8-bit synthesizer sounds though. Perhaps I will start an tutorial series of that too. It is damn interesting.  The next video btw. It'll be THE battle, something original and loud. See it as a thank-you!\"" },

Really stressful actually was Sony Vegas. I had it like 5 times that the video was laggy. The first one was number 8, Undefeated Heart. I was pretty angry about the lagging video which came out of nowhere. And then in the Sims cover, the same happened again. I downloaded other video software and used the Trial to export the project but nothing worked. Really glad that I managed that part. Yeah, I often had re-rendering too on the audio as well as the video. I often found a mistake or a little noise somewhere. I was clever this time and kept my project files alive. Luckily I have a 1TB hard drive, not like two years ago, where I just had 100GB  These were the main problems I got but there is always a solution right? About the song! Ocarina Of Time is a really good game for sure. I remember playing it with my sister getting into the castle and sneak through the guards. That was fun. When you get introduced with Zelda, I immediately listened to that beautiful tune. Mister Kondo is a master in making these short pieces. After you get this song for the Ocarina, surely I will never forget this theme in my life.  ----------------- If you liked my Christmas calender, you can buy this album for 2$ (it actually should cost only 2$ but Loudr said, I have to raise it up. :/ Sorry.

I hope the album will be finished this year (because of licensing but big PROPS to Loudr, which make a good job in those area) but if not, you will definitely get the videos to hear!  I made these videos from 5 - 30 November, so it basically was everyday plus two days. I thought I need that much of space but I did really well I guess! Just to be sure to do this 100% xD  I probably can tell you, what really happens two years ago, where I had to cancel it. On the 10 December, I smoked my first cigarette and I think, this made me really ill haha! This was a bad decision but hey, who did not. Meanwhile, cigarettes are okay but I don't feel to be addicted to them to be honest. But: Each to their own.  This song is probably the best song to start this calender.  You will be able to buy my Christmas calender for a really little bit of money, which I hope is pretty much fair. If not, enjoy the Youtube version. Since I don't celebrate Christmas, I hope my work will be appreciated an then I can lay down for the end of the Year saving for a new main guitar I wanna get since so many years.  Damn, this year flew quick though. But I think I made it better than last year.  Thanks on this point to my friends, who supported me and suggested some songs in that calender! Also for entertaining me over the recording time, big thanks for Lookslikelink and RubinNischara for their Let's Plays. It kinda got really stressful but I was never bored watching their videos!   For tomorrow, I have a happy. groovy song! It will be juicy and colorful with.two.screens.blub.wuiiiiii\"" },

What I like about this game are the individual characters. I mean look at them. They are all different! Design technique is best. Good thing is that community can suggest every sorrow they have so the developers have a good aim to aim of. Please: If you can, buy the game and support the developers. If you don't know them: It's Gearbox. Yes, they made Borderlands too. And yes, the game also has a lot of funny dialogues. Such highly recommend as I said.

I just...... was ... to stupid? I can play actually really good and really fast but I was not able to play this main riff here. hm, so weird, just so weird. Finally I managed it but while recording the video, I still struggled to record it. If you want to cover this: Good luck. I think, this was controlled by the binaural beats or so that I wasn't able. LOL! haha sorry for the video fails. 4 songs already. It's getting hard. ^^  tomorrow christian broadcast TV mom! nuff said......\"" },

That's the only explaining!   You know, as a kid, I was getting really brutal with bombs so I throw them everywhere in the next to this shouting guy because of not understanding his problems and his attitude being  loudly!

You can see 6 rows on there, the first one has the \"\"Terzen\"\" on there, the second row is the main row; it has the bass tones, so in the middle is a C, left from it, there's F, Bb and so on and the right side has G, D and so on, so it's ordered in the \"\"Qintenzirkel\"\" (dunno the english words atm in the \"\"\"\" words ) That makes this instrument pretty easy to play styles like this one, the Bavarian Fol Music, which seems pretty well-known in other countries like in America, because they got this big part of Bavaria in the history of the past. In the North, it's kinda not that popular and for me most teens, it's not that much enjoyable, I personally think, but for me, it's kinda LOL, I have to say!

It would be very weird if you play piano but you hate classical music or you play e guitar with high distortion, although you hate metal.

There are a lot of good intros; intros from Pokemon Colosseum or Soul Calibur 2 I remember right now are some good ones. But seriously, this one tops everything! It was pretty necessary to show this because if you start the game, you don't really find out, what happened or what's the point. And story is actually pretty important. The intro with this fitting music is a nice combination, so that'S why I put game scenees in there. I hope you enjoy it!  Next week, FINALLY, my summer holidays starts. Everyone already has summer holidays and I needed to wait so long. :( Good news are that I didn't need to repeat the school, which makes me more happier to cover more in the holidays. 6 weeks means 6 covers but the first and the third cover will be medleys like I did it last year the same.  That means, next week, I'll start with an childhood brutal nostalgic cover, where I spent so much time with it. These games also have 6 generations! See ya. :)\"" },

I can not really say why, it's actually not possible to hold that still like he can hold this weapon that still but that doesn't make it easier because the entire Team Fortress 2 characters are moving weird, like drunky drunks Demopans. Uuups, that wasn't medicine, I always think then! (aha, it is medic's fault!!! Caught!)  His weapons are nice. As I wrote in this video (sorry for being stupid), I like the Huntsman and the Sniper with the Silencer, although I often play with the AWPHand because not everybody has it and I still think, it can shoot flashes. :D (maybe in the kill picture, engineers were on the way with short circuits. ^^) Nonetheless, the Huntsman or the new bow with two strings on it (how unnecessary) is pretty cool too. It always feels good if you kill somebody with a headshot with it! Or even more a headshot with an burned arrow, that's even more impressive! Thanks Pyro for helping us Snipers out there. (Pyro on the drums as guest I guess/know) Joa, the Sniper's weapon are pretty different.   If I use a sniper, I like the combination of this rucksack and this brown knife to blood somebody.

Well, everybody would make some harvest on the field or mining, that's how you get it faster than collecting grass on the ground and selling it then.   This Spring theme fits so well in this game. I also really liked the appearance of this theme in the Harvest Moon DS game, what I really want to play as well. But yeah, this appearance with this new remix of the song, which sounds a lot better brought me to cover it! We also have spring so it fits together. I hope you enjoy the cover and the variations I tried in there. You know, I am pretty bad to remix a song good and make cool variations so yeah, I want to improve that in the next videos! =)  Next week, I don'T know, either a song from a tiny village or I cover the most known theme ever in Weed Mode! =D\"" },

I saw Phantom Hourglass and when I saw, that you can control your boomerang with drawing a line on the screen, I immediately wanted this game!   After a time, I got it but I didn't play it because I don't know, I didn't want to play it, because of the gameplay, I think. I thought, you only need to control by drawing with the touchpen when you use the boomerang but the whole time that control management? I dunno...  The Easter holidays came here and then, I said to me, that I need to play this game, because I got it but I didn't play it. wtf, who buys games and don't play them? I have to say, that the game looks overall very awesome so I forced myself to play it and then, I got really addicted. In my opinion, this is one of the best Zelda games out there. I uploaded this medley, because there are almost the easter holidays here so I got a high nostalgic push while making this cool medley. Well, the song choice could be a bit werid; I already have done the Pirate Ship Theme but the game hasn't that much cool melodic songs and I didn't want to play evil boss theme songs at the end, what I normally do in Medleys. So I hope you enjoy it nevertheless and if you didn't play this game, then I recommend it and maybe you give it a try because of the story, you miss something cool on a Zelda game!

The final of this film gave me idea to this cover! Hope you enjoy it!  Two City Alert! Let's go to Rottenburg! There you can see Medic's hometown.  I always thought, Medic's hometown is Stuttgart in Germany! In the TF2 wiki, I am pretty sure, it stands there. Well, that doesn't matter, I do like half-timbered houses like in this city. Because they are old but still stable.  I don't know, why the medic is not so good in english like me, he sometimes use german words like \"\"Schweinshund\"\", \"\"Kamerad\"\" or \"\"Fr√§ulein\"\". But that's okay. He can be very useful in Rottenburg or Mannhatten to cover you from the rockets and bullets of the enemy robots. Does anyone know, if his shield protect sniper bullets as well? Well, well well, without him, it can be very dangerous to go into the fight. Especially playing as pyro can be very good with his help.   I do still enjoy playing as Scout; collecting money makes so much fun. My tip: Upgrade your jump height, then your speed and crit resistance can also be good and don't forget the mad milk with the skill to slow down enemys.   As Soldier, I have no idea, what strategie is the best. I think, the blackbox is always good for getting heal from other enemys and a buff banner would be good too. That's what I know.  As Pyro, it's important to get killheals and airblast power. In Mannhatten, it's pretty cool to push enemys in the mincer. But watch out for yourself from the Banana; Donkey Kong was there. When they come from Controlpoint A, I always stand right from the entrance to it and blow them down right into it!   As Demoman, I also don't know and I think, it's pretty hard sometimes to keep survive. And then not foget to kill the medics with the sticky bombs. He can be a very important person for that, but if your team has a good blow pyro, he can overdo the job eventually.   As Heavy, it's like: Upgrade your gun and shoot all of it, what you can! I prefer the Natasha, because of making the big scouts slow, if the scout in your team needs to recharge his mad milk or other circumstances.  As Engineer, I immediately upgrade the dispenser range. As Heavy, Soldier, simply every class who shoots, it's annoying if you running out of ammo. At second, I always grab some Building up Level 3 canteens, because a big soldier or heavy can destroy your sentry very quick, so you can rebuild fast!  As Medic, the protecting shield is first priority and duty! As second, I always don't know, what all these designation means, so I think yolo and click everything on. But watch out getting the right medigun. I do like the normal medigun.  As Sniper and Spy, I have no idea, but important is to be good with them. I remember a situation, where someone played Spy and everybody said, that he should change but he pleasured for one round fighting with spy. He had surprised us very hard, all thought, that he's a bad spy. I didn't see yet a really good sniper like this spy, but I think, there are some in this world!

To be honest, I really enjoyed that as a kid! :)  I hope you like my arrangement, that I put into it!. Next week, fitting to Friday 13th, a cover, which has a 13 in the title (and what reminds me a bit of christmas, although it has nothing to do with it).\"" },

I failed and failed and failed and ask myself, why.   So the next days, I made a new world and began to play, without cheating. (my old save state got lost unfortunately) And I still played and thought, why this game makes so addicted. I did not have any idea, why it was so, so I played further and fought against the Eye of Cludud√∂ldudo or what the names is of this boss. And there I heard the soundtrack and I remember, that I didn't cover this song yet, so I thought, it must be done.   Of course, there are new cool soundtracks in this game since 1.2 but this was a theme, I wanted to do first, before I do the new ones. So do not desperate, I will do them still this year! ;)  Next week some christmas stuff until Sylvester. I will start with an old classic song from a old game. \"" },

Gerudo Valley was the first, I looked for a metal cover. Uhhm, that must have been in Autumn 2010, where I got the Zelda Collector's Edition and played Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask the first time complete through. I think, they are many people, who didn't beat that game in a young age, or maybe I was to dumb, because I couldn't read English, when I was about 6-7 years old! ;)  Gerudo Valley, omg, as I said, I didn't complete the game, so I just start the Game only to play a little here and there, tried out to find new stuff and it made me always sad, not to come further in the game. I always wanted to get through the barrier behind the Gerudo woman and it had never worked. I wanted to get further, but I stuck on Jabu Jabu's Stomach, where I wonder, why Princess Ruto disappear while you're wearing her out of the mouth. So I just started the game to get to the bridge to Gerudo Valley and I always, ALWAYS enjoyed it to jump from the bridge into the deep canyon filled with water, where the flow float you in Hyrule's Sea. At the end of my old N64 game time, where my second controller was broken, because I breaked off the control stick ( :D while Super Smash Bros :D ) and my first one, where the joystick reacted very badly, it was a hard way to hell to get over there. On the way, the flying pineapples makes your way much more harder. To be honest, the control sticks weren't the best, compared to the Gamecube's one. When I pressed it forward, Link sneaked very low but backwards was okay, so I always ran backwards, because it was much more faster but as a kid really annoying, then I got the game when I was 15 years old and then, running forwards costs to much time, so I ran backwards all the time. I just say: ..... yeah.....   By the way, I hope you enjoy this cover, it was pretty cool to use the old good Fender bass and to use the first time a old classical one. We have another one (used in my Team Fortress 2 - The Calm/ROBOTS cover), but this I got in this video, it's older, sounds better and have a name; but not the exactly one. Hope you also enjoy my solo, it was improved. ^^  Next week comes a yin & yang!\"" },

On the way to Sunnyshore, there are a lot of good trainers and wild grass to train your Pokemon either for the gym leader in Sunnyshore or for the Top 4! This route, I can't remember the Route number, always was my training route to make my Pokemon stronger and better.  The city was also there to check your Pokemons about their properties. That was useful to get in a luxury house somewhere out of the Pokemon Region, can't remember that as well! There was a women behind of the main door, who stops you, when you enter the house and she wants to look for your Pokemon, if they have some special properties!

If there's not a melody, then it's always the same chord (in this example C) with a lot of variations! Like Death Metal songs, where you let growl your guitar on a deep Drop A riff and playing some variations! So if someone means, that is no music, he has no idea. :P No music is sitting with the fat ass on a piano to make some noise! And this song is not created by sitting on a piano with a tight backside, it was created by Scott McMillan and this dubstep tune is awesome! It fits pretty good together and I am not sure, but if the gun is only a kind of joke weapon, it turned out to a pretty serious thing, that they create! Nice job!  And yeah, hope you like it! Of course, it will never sound so good as Dubstep and Electronic music but I tried the best out of it!   I hope you enjoy the new Drums, I bought! It is the Metal Machine expansion pack for EZDrummer, which means, that you need to buy EZDrummer first and then, further expansion are allowed to use!

Then I got a new world with a lot better location! But first, I checked out the Options! There was a button for the difficulty! I didn't know, what \"\"Peaceful\"\" meant, so I chose \"\"Easy\"\" in hope, that it's the easiest difficulty! Because first. I only wanted to build, not to fight! Then I looked for the sound options, because there was no music and I thought, I turned it off! But it was on! I was very confused!   So my first house was finish and it was getting dark very fast! I saw really uncool monsters outside and I immediately went to my home! Then, the wonderful piece of music appeared! I wondered, why they took such calm music like these! But this kind of music fits perfect with Minecraft! Well, with the old Minecraft......   Close your eyes and enjoy the music, if you had the same connection like me with this great game! The graphic was never something bad for me, I like those games! Well, nevertheless, it will come the special brutal australian guest on Friday! See you then! ;)\"" },

With this game, all starts with nostalgic! Because it's the best game on the Gamecube and so much cool and so!  All starts in my favorite electronic shop! (Mediamarkt) I was there, Juni 2005 and I found two games: Starfox Adventures and Starfox Assault! My mom said one game and I accept the thinking deciding challenge, which one can be better! My father was somewhere else, which was good, because he didn't really like Videogames, makes dumb and uneducated and so! Well, she said, Starfox Assault looks better with all the pistols but I chose Adventures, because of the staff I think!  At home, I immediately tried it out! It was so cool! At the next day, I tried it again! I didn't know, how I come further so my mom first asked me to bring some breads for the breakfast! I immediately went to the bakery! After that, I didn't know, what I need to do! I rescued Tricky and we needed 6 yellow mushrooms to help her mother! From then on, it took me one week to find out, that there's a crack in the wall in the near from a kind of fountain! The other things, I discovered very fast and after some days, I complete the game!  Then, one year later, I sold this game and thought it was okay! Because after you have completed it, you can't do nothing except beating Andross! Yeah yeah, but after 2 years again, (2009) I found this game when I searched for some games in eBay! With a lot of games, this was there and I needed it back! That was one of the coolest moments in my life! I definitely recommend this game to everyone! ;)  Hope you enjoy the medley, although one of the other one would like to see some newer stuff, I am sorry for that! Because next week will come a special guest from Australia and he's brutal!\"" },

I didn't play F Zero on the N64, but in my opinion, the hardest game on the Gamecube is F Zero GX and for the N64 this one!   I love the snow levels here. They are very nice and the music of this one was my favorite. As I said, it's nicely made; at the start, you drive to a hillside and you see those nice Christmas houses in the distance, then you turn right into a forest with a lot of fog, where's a shortcut, once you get out of the tunnel and after that, there's a waterfall, which you can shortcut too, if you have the hovercraft and that's it!

I chose Engineer, went to the top of the base (where often the snipers are) and I tried to build a sentry. yeah, okay, it was going up, okay, so far so good! But then it was finish and was only a Level 1 sentry. I was very disappointed and I didn't know, what I should do. So I closed the game. On Monday, I asked my friends, why it didn't work. They said: Use your fucking wrench, bitch! I thought: Okay, okay, don't freak out! I mean, it was dumbness, but nobody start with a potion of experience. So I tried it out on the Map Dustbowl in the area, where the control point is, when you go over a bridge. For non-TF2 player: Dustbowl is a map, where you can play on three different areas on the whole map.

But there were a lot of Fake Videos and in one of these, you can see, that Pyro, without the mask, is a woman, who is the announcer. He/She says: \"\"Victory\"\".  But why he/she? That's the big secret! In July 2012, Valve released the Video. To the video: It's great, it's in my Top 3 of the best ones. I like to see the POV of the Pyro, so that's the reason, why he/she is always happy to kill/play with the other guys.  But why does the Scout say before he, then she? What is the real gender?

Above all, the new sapper makes the sentrys a level lower, that's perfect for a nest of sentrys and Engineers.   All in one, he's a cool guy, he's from France but it isn't easy to play him well. That needs a bit of training. I am also not good with him but it's funny to play spy. sometimes...

I remember, that I played this game with 4 years in the Philippines. I know, that I saw the castle in black/white. Then, I got this game on a market with colour and I thought: omg, this is awesome! It was not to hard, so that little kids can play this game without to become aggressive. And of course, that music is nostalgic. I like them!  Thanks for TheDelRe 's Cover of that song.

I like this stage really, it's my favorite, although it is one of the hardest stages there because of the machine room in the ship.

It's classic and a wonderful melody, I think. It makes Zelda ambience and yeah... Sometimes, when I record this, I gotta headache because I don't like very high notes, so the song has more bass and less treble. Also I try a mastering with a Multiband Compressor and some other things, that someone need to master, 'cause I don't had master my songs before. (Only EQing) The reason, why I don't like to master is because I think, the guitars does sound weird but this well, may it's normal. Well, about the song: Its pretty cool! I named it only TLoZ, because there are more Zelda games with this song. Of course, this theme was the first in the first Zelda game. I have this game on a Collector's Edition for the Gamecube, it was rather hard this game but I highly recommend this Edition, there are both N64 games and both NES games, too. :D\"" },

And the second mission had a funny name (Krawall im All = riot in the space; but it's a rhyme in German) and I don't know, I hadn't forgotten this track, lol, although I had played this game one time in my life. Sometimes, I  play the 3DS version of it, it has a better gameplay and graphic (And weird voices, like the voice from Slippy in the GER Version). Cool game!

One day, I wanted to sleep by him and he showed me game from beginning and I was interested about the game play. In the night, I played it very long and he gave me tips and tricks for this game, because I was addicted! :D It's simply a good game but that's my only FF Game, that I've played. I don't touch the PS Games from FF, but this version for the GBA was cool enough, that I don't want to try them. Good game, good game and beautiful soundtrack, this one.

Last week, it came a new Game Mode and the trailer was awesome, I like it more than all the \"\"Meet the XYZ\"\" Trailers. It's s cool, how Scout and the Heavy fight against the robots and they go along the way. So I put the first time Game Scenes in this video.   Creating this song was very annoying. Sometimes, Mixcraft thinks, it could crash to make me crazy! And then, the MIDI tones they went crazy, too. Mastering took me a long time but even I did it and I hope you enjoy!
